## 1. What went well
- I now have an understanding of how **React components work**, how they can be reused through importing and exporting, and how various React hooks function and interact within an application. 
- My knowledge of **Git** has also improved significantly. I now understand how commands such as **git reset**, **git rebase**, and **git revert** work, as well as the advantages of making **macro commits over micro commits**, allowing me to manage version control more efficiently and maintain a cleaner project history.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- My biggest challenge was **discipline and time management**. Throughout the semester, I did not spend enough time upskilling or practicing beyond the fundamentals.  
- Because of poor habits such as **doomscrolling, procrastination, etc.**, I limited my growth and missed opportunities to improve my coding skills.  
- As a result, I feel that I could have learned much more if I had managed my time better and stayed more focused.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I gained an understanding of **React fundamentals** and how to structure a web application.  
- I developed a clearer understanding of **React’s component-based architecture**, how components can be reused, and how **data flows** within an application.  
- I also learned the importance of **version control**, collaboration, and maintaining a clean project workflow using Git and GitHub.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I aim to **eliminate bad habits**, reduce distractions, and build **stronger self-discipline**.  
- I want to **grow more as a student** by consistently practicing, learning new technologies, and expanding my skills beyond React.  
- My goal is not only to get good grades but also to **prepare myself for the future career** I want in software and application development.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I expect to **be more disciplined and consistent** in learning and practicing coding.  
- I want to gain a strong foundation in **mobile application development**, understand how mobile apps are structured, and apply best practices in UI/UX and performance.  
- I also hope to **improve my problem-solving skills**, coding confidence, and ability to build real-world mobile applications.  
- Most importantly, I want to **prove to myself that I can improve, grow, and become a better developer**.
